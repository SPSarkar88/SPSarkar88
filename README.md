 I'm SP, a Full Stack Developer have experienced in <b>Spring (Java)</b> and <b>.Net(C#)</b>. I do have also used Angular and React while developing enterprise applications. As a freelance developer, I have built 8 MVP using <b>.Net,</b> <b>Django</b>, <b>Express</b> with combination of <b>Angular</b> or <b>React</b>I also work with  <b>Winforms and Delphi</b> stack in my off time. 

I love learning ins and outs of technology and sharing knowledge that I have learned through my blogs. I try to follow the best practice while building solutions but sometimes solving problems takes more priority than the best possible industry practice. 
 
I like agile methodologies, testable clean code, and a small change code commit approach. I love to read books.
