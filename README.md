<h4 align="left">About Me</h4>
<p align="left">
I'm Subhra Prakash Sarkar from India, a Full Stack Developer in <b>.Net+Angular/React</b>. I also work with  <b>Django+Angular/React and MEAN or MERN</b> stack in my off time (mostly weekends). 

I love learning ins and outs of technology and sharing knowledge what I have learned through my blogs. I try to follow the best practice while building solutions but sometimes solving problems takes more priority than the best possible industry practice. 
 
I like agile methodologies, testable clean code, and a small change code commit approach. I love to read books.

 - I am currently working full-time as a Open source Developer and developing Enterprise application using with `React` and `C#(.NET)`.
 - I am currently practicing React with TypeScript.
