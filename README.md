<p align="left">
 I'm Subhra, a Full Stack Developer have experienced in <b>Spring Boot</b> and <b>.Net| .Net Core | .Net Framework</b>. I do have also user Angular and React while developing enterprise application as well as MVP for startups. I also work with  <b>Django+Angular/React and MEAN or MERN</b> stack in my off time (mostly weekends). 

I love learning ins and outs of technology and sharing knowledge what I have learned through my blogs. I try to follow the best practice while building solutions but sometimes solving problems takes more priority than the best possible industry practice. 
 
I like agile methodologies, testable clean code, and a small change code commit approach. I love to read books.
